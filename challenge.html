    <p>On December 20 I decided to get a head start on one of my goals for 2020 - completing the 100 days of code challenge. The idea behind the challenge is simple - code for at least an hour a day, every day, for 100 days. You can code in any language or languages you want to learn, and your learning plan can be as structured or unstructured as you like. </p>

<p>Here’s roughly how mine broke down:</p>

<p>Days 1- 3<br>
Responsive Web Design on <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/">freecodedamp</a></p>

<p>Days 4 - 17<br>
Javascript on <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/">freecodedamp</a></p>

<p>Days 18 - 21<br>
Frontend libraries on <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/">freecodedamp</a></p>

<p>Days 22 - 24<br>
CSS layouts course on <a href = "https://designcode.io/">designcode.io</a></p>

<p>Days 25 - 27<br>
Greensock animation course on <a href = "https://designcode.io/">designcode.io</a></p>

<p>Days 29 - 32<br>
React for Designers course on <a href = "https://designcode.io/">designcode.io</a></p>

<p>Days 33 - 40<br>
Creative Coding course on <a href = "https://www.superhi.com/">SueprHi</a></p>

<p>Days 43 - 52<br>
Experimental JavaScript course on on <a href = "https://www.superhi.com/">SueprHi</a></p>

<p>Days 53 - 65<br>
Random <a href = "https://www.superhi.com/">SueprHi</a> tutorials and working on my project page</p>

<p>Days 66 - 76<br>
Experimental JavaScript course on on <a href = "https://www.superhi.com/">SueprHi</a></p>

<p>Days 77 - 88<br>
Ajax and APIs course on on <a href = "https://www.superhi.com/">SueprHi</a></p>

<p>Days 89 - 98<br>
JavaScript for Designers course on <a href = "https://www.superhi.com/">SueprHi</a></p>

<p>Days 99-100<br>
Putting the finishing touches on this project page</p>

<p>In the past 100 days I’ve:<br>
Learned a lot of JavaScript<br>
Gotten more comfortable with HTML and CSS<br>
Learned tools like Git, Github, Netlify, Hyper, VS Code, Contentful, and various APIs<br>
Learned a little bit of Sass, Bootstrap, jQuery, React, Greensock, Web GL, and Ajax<br>
Experimented with different JavaScript libraries, including two.js, three.js, matter.js, and PIXI.js.</p>

<p>What’s next?<br>
I need a bit of a break from the daily hustle right now, but I’m nowhere near done learning.<br>
I still have a handful of SuperHi courses to finish, plus a new course launching this month I want to take.<br>
I’d also like to do the JS 30 at some point, and possibly some sort of CSS challenge as well.<br>
I want to spend more time working on projects that don’t involve following tutorials, and will probably start by using my new skills to update my portfolio.<br>
Sounds like that might be enough for another 100 day challenge...Stay tuned!</p>
